# pwnagotchi-personalities

### DISCLAIMER

This modification only changes the english text as it changes the `voice.py` file. This will not work if your pwnagotchi isn't set to english.

### Installation

Clone the repository and replace the `voice.py` file in your `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi` folder with one of the `voice.py` files from the repo to change your pwnagotchi's personality!
